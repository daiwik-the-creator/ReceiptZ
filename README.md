# ReceiptZ
ReceiptZ is a receipt-splitting utility tool developed in C++ designed to simplify group expenses. Available currently as a command-line application, users can efficiently input itemized receipts and the tool will automatically calculate and split costs among multiple participants based on customizable criteria such as individual shares or group percentages.

Coming Soon:

- A GUI that will provide a more intuitive experience, allowing users to navigate effortlessly and interact with the tool seamlessly (future updates to include a graphical interface).

- An innovative feature that will enable users to upload images of receipts, utilizing optical character recognition (OCR) technology to extract itemized data automatically, streamlining the input process.
